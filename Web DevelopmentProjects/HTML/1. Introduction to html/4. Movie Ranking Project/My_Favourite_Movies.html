<h2>Poem from a favourite movie</h2>

<h3>Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara</h3>


<p>From "Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara," here's a famous 4-line poem: <br>

"Dilon mein tum apni <br>
Betaabiyan leke chal rahe ho <br>
Toh zinda ho tum <br> 
Nazar mein khwaabon ki bijliyan leke chal rahe ho" <br>

<h4>Translation: </h4>

"If you carry impatience in your hearts <br>
Then you are alive <br>
If you carry lightning bolts of dreams in your eyes <br>
Then you are alive" <br>
