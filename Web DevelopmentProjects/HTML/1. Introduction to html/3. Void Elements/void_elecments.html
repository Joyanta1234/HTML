<!-- first one is <hr> tag. Ok, let me explain one thing. In basically
most case people use <hr> but in the XHTML or strict html we have to close the
tag like <hr /> -->


<h1>Starry Serenade</h1>

<!-- br tag mostly use to break the line like below -->
<p>In twilight's gentle, fading hue,<br>
Stars emerge in skies so blue. <br>
Whispers of the night take flight, <br>
Embracing dreams with soft delight. <br>
